excerpt: "The SoccerNet 2022 challenges were the second annual video understanding challenges organized by the SoccerNet team. In 2022, the challenges were composed of 6 vision-based tasks  action spotting, focusing on retrieving action timestamps in long untrimmed videos,  replay grounding, focusing on retrieving the live moment of an action shown in a replay,  pitch localization, focusing on detecting line and goal part elements,  camera calibration, dedicated to retrieving the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters,  player re-identification, focusing on retrieving the same players across multiple views, and  multiple object tracking, focusing on tracking players and the ball through unedited video streams. Compared to last year's challenges, tasks  had their evaluation metrics redefined to consider tighter temporal accuracies, and tasks  were novel, including their underlying data and annotations."
