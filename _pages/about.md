My name is <b>Artur Xarles</b>, and I am currently pursuing a PhD at [Universitat de Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/es/inicio) under the supervision of Prof. [Sergio Escalera](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=oI6AIkMAAAAJ&hl=ca&oi=ao), Prof. [Albert Clapés](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=n4BtpPsAAAAJ&hl=ca&oi=ao), and Prof. [Thomas B. Moeslund](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=XmkDts4AAAAJ&hl=ca&oi=ao). My primary research interests lie in the field of computer vision, with a particular focus on video understanding, especially as applied to sports. My recent contributions have focused on advancing the state of the art in action spotting in various sports videos.

In 2021, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Applied Statistics from [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467950436.html) (UAB), followed by a Master's degree in Fundamental Principles of Data Science from Universitat de Barcelona (UB). My Master's thesis, supervised by Sergio Escalera and Albert Clapés in the [HuPBA group](https://sergioescalera.com/students/), was centered on the task of action spotting in soccer videos. This work received the award for the second-best BSc or MSc thesis in Applied Artificial Intelligence from the [Catalan Association for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.acia.cat/).
